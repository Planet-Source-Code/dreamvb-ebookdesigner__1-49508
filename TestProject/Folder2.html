        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok now 
          following on from our last exercise of creating our folder. I will now 
          explain how we can rename and delete a folder.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To rename 
          a folder click on your new created folder right click on the folder 
          you will then see a menu form this menu select rename. You will then 
          see that the folder text is then highlighted as shown in this screen 
          show below:<br>
          <img src="folder2.jpg" width="87" height="61"> <br>
          <br>
          While the text is still highlighted type in any name you wont e.g. &quot;Test 
          Folder&quot; without the quotes. For the new folder name to take effect 
          you will need to press the enter key. There you go you have just renamed 
          a folder.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We now 
          move on to deleting a folder. To do this is simple simply right click 
          on your folder and select Delete from the menu. You will now see a dialog 
          box appear on the screen asking, &quot;if your sure you want to delete 
          the folder&quot; as shown in the screen shot below:</font><br>
          <br>
          <img src="folder3.gif" width="234" height="98"> <br>
          <br>
          <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For this 
          example we can simplay click on the Yes button. That's it your folder 
          has now been deleted. anway I hoped you liked this little tutor.<br>
          <br>
          O just one quick note before I go if you ever deleted the folder by 
          mistake just simply right click your mouse and select Undo Delete, This 
          will then bring back your folder unless you have emptyed your recycle 
          bin.</font></p>
